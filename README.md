### Running

* For training TSM or MSNet on Something-v1, use the following command:
```bash
    ./scripts/train_TSM_Something_v1.sh local
```

* For training TSM or MSNet on Kinetics, use the following command:
```bash
    ./scripts/train_TSM_Kinetics.sh local
```

* For testing your trained model on Something-v1, use the following command:
```bash
    ./scripts/test_TSM_Something_v1.sh local
```

* For testing your trained model on Kinetics, use the following command:
```bash
    ./scripts/test_TSM_Kinetics.sh local
